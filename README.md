Welcome to my collection of Natural Language Processing projects! This repository showcases various NLP techniques and applications using Python, spaCy, and NLTK.

## 📚 Projects Overview

### 1. 🎯 Named Entity Recognition (NER)
**File:** `Applying NER to Identify Entities.ipynb`

Implemented Named Entity Recognition using spaCy to identify and classify entities such as:
- Person names
- Organizations
- Locations
- Dates and times

**Key Concepts:** Entity extraction, sentence segmentation, text parsing

**Technologies:** Python, spaCy

---

### 2. 📧 SMS Spam Detection
**Files:** `SMS_Spam_Detection.ipynb`, `Spamsms.ipynb`

Built a text classification model to detect spam messages in SMS data.

**Features:**
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Classification using machine learning algorithms
- Model evaluation and performance metrics

**Technologies:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NLTK

---

### 3. 📄 PDF Text Extraction & Processing
**Files:** `NLP for PDF.ipynb`, `Pdf_to_text.ipynb`

Extracting and processing text from PDF documents for NLP analysis.

**Applications:**
- Document digitization
- Text mining from research papers
- Automated content extraction

**Technologies:** Python, PyPDF2/pdfplumber, NLTK

---

### 4. 🔤 Text Preprocessing Techniques

#### Stemming & Lemmatization
**Files:** 
- `Stemming and Lemmatization.ipynb`
- `Stemming & lemmatization by spacy.ipynb`
- `Stemming and lematization by nltk.ipynb`

Exploring word normalization techniques using both spaCy and NLTK:
- **Stemming:** Reducing words to their root form
- **Lemmatization:** Converting words to their base dictionary form

**Use Cases:** Text normalization, information retrieval, search optimization

---

#### Stop Words Removal
**File:** `Stop words.ipynb`

Removing common words that don't add significant meaning to text analysis.

**Purpose:** Improves model performance by focusing on meaningful content

---

#### Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging
**File:** `Pos basics.ipynb`

Identifying grammatical categories of words in sentences (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.)

**Applications:** Syntax analysis, information extraction, text understanding

---

#### Regular Expressions
**File:** `Regular exxpression.ipynb`

Pattern matching and text extraction using regex in NLP tasks.

**Use Cases:** Text validation, data extraction, string manipulation
